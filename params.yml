# Track configuration
#####
# List of binned quantitative genomic tracks to use for visualization of 
# eigenspace and clustering.
# Each track has a type:
#   * category: categorical data
#   * scalar: quantitative
#   * divergent: quantitative, but the default colorscale will be centered at 0.
# Colormapping options for matplotlib/datashader can be specified.
# Each track type has associated default options which can be overridden.
